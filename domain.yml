######################### About University ########################
  utter_aboutmtu/about_university:
  - text: |- 
            The proprietor of the Mountain Top University is the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM), a Christian missionary organisation founded by Dr. Daniel Kolawole Olukoya.
            
            The vision for the establishment of the Ministry was received in August but it was not until July 1989 that the Ministry commenced. The commission started with 24 members and as at today, the church has millions of worshippers worldwide. MFM runs missionary activities in over 40 nations of the world cutting across Africa, Europe, America and Asia. As a Christian missionary organisation, the MFM is a full gospel ministry devoted to the revival of apostolic signs.
            
            The core vision of MFM is total liberty of men and women from all forms of oppressions and bondages through the teaching of biblical principles and aggressive prayer strategies for a victorious living. It is against this backdrop that the vision for the establishment of Mountain Top University was derived from the founding ministry.
            
            The promulgation of the Education Decree No. 9 of 1993, which repealed the Decree No. 19 of 1984 and stipulated new guidelines on the establishment of private universities was therefore a welcome development. Mountain Top University is one of the private Universities in Nigeria.


  utter_aboutmtu/history_university:

            The University is a confederation of Colleges and Departments. The Colleges are governed by their own statutes and regulations, 
            
            but are integral to the make-up of the Mountain Top University. There are two Colleges, which each form an administrative grouping of departments. 
            
            They are:
              •	College of Basic and Applied Sciences
              •	College of Humanities and Management Sciences
            
            There is a Council of each College – including representatives of its Departments. The Schools are represented on the General Board.
            
            MTU’s diverse community — comprising students, Colleges, staff, parents and more — work together on more than research and education. Outside of the classroom, student clubs, staff organizations and religious life groups are just some of the ways community comes together at the Institute.
